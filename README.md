# Unit 9 (Node.js/ES6) Homework: Read Me Generator

With this homework assignment, I was tasked with creating a command-line application that will
dynamically generate a README.md with the input of a user. The user will be prompted, using the inquirer package from NPM, for their GITHub username, project title, description of the project, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, and tests. The answer from these prompts will be used to create the read me file. 


## User Story

```
AS A developer

I WANT a README generator

SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project

```

## Business Context 

When starting a new project, it is important to have an awesome readme. Rather than creating one manually, a command-line application will allow for quick generation of readme for new projects.

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

* The generated README includes a bio image from the user's GitHub profile.

* The generated README includes the user's email.

* The generated README includes the following sections: 
  * Title
  * Description
  * Table of Contents
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License
  * Contributing
  * Tests
  * Questions

* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.

```
